## BrightData
### Web Unlocker
1. This is the proxy we used from BrightData to scrape the other websites
2. We only give a `solution` name without geo location targeting, premium domains, async requests, nor advanced options for custom headers and cookies. 
3. We will refer to the `host` of the proxy scraper such as `brd.superproxy.io:22225`, `username`, and `password`.
4. Note that we keep `username` and `password` in environment variables.
